# ClassCentral webpage translated into Hindi

# This project is composed of four files: 

1- scapping.py: scarpping data and save it in index.html file using python libraries.

2- index.html: main file and contain all html and css code.

3- index.js: jQuery and Javascript functions. main function to handle the one level deep links. as you see in it i iterate over all links and 
if i find it start with "\" that's mean that it lacks the main domain then I add https://www.classcentral.com to make the link valid. 

4- 1.png: this image could be found in images folder. why? because when I scrapped the classcentral webpage the images were downloded out of focus. 
So, i just wanted to show one solution which could be applied on all images. but while this I will try to find a better way to scapping to download the 
images in full resolution.
